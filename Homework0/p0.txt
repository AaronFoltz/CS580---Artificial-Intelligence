CS 580								Due:  September 7, 2011Fall 2011De Jong					Homework #0This is a simple warmup exercise.  There is nothing intellectually difficult to be done.  Rather, your grade will depend on your ability to follow instructions precisely.

You are to copy the files from the directory /pub/ftp/kdejong/cs580/hw0 on Mason to your own workspace. Using whatever means you prefer, you are to capture in a file p0.out the output of a Lisp session in which you successfully load and execute p0.lsp on p0.dat.  Depending on your local environment, you may need to edit the path name "p0.dat" in p0.lsp in order to execute successfully.You are to submit your homework as a SINGLE email to tsaha@masonlive.gmu.edu formatted in the following way: - the subject field of the email should read: CS580 HW#0  De Jong - the content of the email should be:	Your name	CS580 Fall 2011	De Jong	Homework #0	(A short summary stating whether you were successful, describing        any problems, etc.)You should attach to this message 3 separate files (NOT 3 separate email messages):	p0.lsp	p0.dat	p0.outAs a safety precaution, always CC yourself when you submit homework this way and keep it around until it has been graded and returned.
