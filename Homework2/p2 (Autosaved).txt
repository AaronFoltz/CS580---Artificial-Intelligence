CS 580									Due: September 21, 2011Fall 2011De Jong				Lisp Homework #2You are to extend the HW1 generator with the capability of reading in and using constraint knowledge to reduce the amount of state space searching required to find puzzle solutions.  The basic idea is that, each time your generator is about to bind an unused symbol to a puzzle object, it should check to see if doing so would violate any constraints.  If so, that particular binding is skipped; otherwise, the generator proceeds as before.For now we will assume constraint knowledge will be specified in several Lisp-convenient forms. The first form we will use is one that expresses negative constraint knowledge such as "Neither Blacket nor Bluet have  either the silver dollar or the ribbon as their lucky charm":	  ( IFFN (NAME BLACKET BLUET)  (CHARM DOLLAR RIBBON) )The puzzle descriptions read in must now be extended to include constraint knowledge:(Widgets			; name of puzzle objects  (features			; list of features and feature values    (name (Wid1 Wid2))    (size (small medium))    (color (red green))    )  (constraints                  ; list of constraints to be satisfied    ( IFFN (name Wid1)  (size medium) )    ( IFFN (color red)  (name Wid1) )    )  )One can then read in a list of such constraints and store them internally in a form which is convenient and efficient for use by your generator.Requirements:1. You are to capture the output of a Lisp session in which you successfully load and execute your code on p2test.dat.

2. Once that is working construct a p2soln.dat consisting of just the baseball puzzle, but with all the IFFN constraints derivable from all 5 sentences.3. You are to submit your homework as a SINGLE email to tsaha@masonlive.gmu.edu formatted in the following way:  - the subject field of the email should read:  CS580 HW#2 De Jong  - the content of the email should be:	- your name	- CS580 Fall 2011	- De Jong	- Homework #2        (A brief report summarizing exactly where you are:  what works, doesn't work, problems, etc.)  - attach to this message 4 separate files: 	- a listing of your program	- a listing of p2soln.dat file	- a listing of the output produced on the p2test.dat file
	- a listing of the output produced on your p2soln.dat fileAs a safety precaution, always CC yourself when you submit homework this way and keep it around until it has been graded and returned.
