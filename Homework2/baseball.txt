Baseball players are notoriously superstitious.  Blacket, Bluet, Browning, Greenfield, and Whitehall are five players on the Boomtown Bombers who each carry a different lucky charm with them in every game.  The charms are: a four-leaf clover, a penny, a rabbit's foot, a ribbon, and a silver dollar. The five positions that they play are: centerfield, first base, right field, shortstop, and third base.  From the information given, determine each player's lucky charm as well as his position.

1. Neither Browning nor the two outfielders have a coin as a lucky charm.

2. Bluet is not an outfielder.

3. Greenfield is an outfielder and Whitehall's infield position is not first base but neither has his lucky charm a clover or a penny and Blacket does not have either of these two lucky charms.

4. Blacket and Bluet are not the players who play first base or third base and neither of them has a lucky ribbon.

5. The centerfielder's lucky charm is not a rabbit's foot.
